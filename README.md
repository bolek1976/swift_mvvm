# swift_mvvm

This is small nighty build project that i just wrote one bored morning on these days you have nothing to loose that crash an app.
Motivation :

Try to figureout how bindings work on SwiftRx. in progress .. :-)

Demonstrate myself how can i achive some bindings like c# do with XAML files, (i did not even get close :-)), but at least theres 
a clean implementation of what you can do with simple things like KVO notifications to get your project lightwight if you just
want implement some design pattern like MVVM.

TODO:
Lot of thins, currently the project only observes NSObject derived classes, (some UIKit aren't ) but this is just a starting point

Thanks for your attention ?
